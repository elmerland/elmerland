<p>IEEE&nbsp;754<!-- /@w --> floating point numbers can represent positive or negative
infinity, and <em>NaN</em> (not a number).  These three values arise from
calculations whose result is undefined or cannot be represented
accurately.  You can also deliberately set a floating-point variable to
any of them, which is sometimes useful.  Some examples of calculations
that produce infinity or NaN:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample"><em>1/0 = &amp;infin;</em>
<em>log (0) = -&amp;infin;</em>
<em>sqrt (-1) = NaN</em>
</pre></div>

<p>When a calculation produces any of these values, an exception also
occurs; see <a href="FP-Exceptions.html#FP-Exceptions">FP Exceptions</a>.
</p>
<p>The basic operations and math functions all accept infinity and NaN and
produce sensible output.  Infinities propagate through calculations as
one would expect: for example, <em>2 + &amp;infin; = &amp;infin;</em>,
<em>4/&amp;infin; = 0</em>, atan <em>(&amp;infin;) = &amp;pi;/2</em>.  NaN, on
the other hand, infects any calculation that involves it.  Unless the
calculation would produce the same result no matter what real value
replaced NaN, the result is NaN.
</p>
<p>In comparison operations, positive infinity is larger than all values
except itself and NaN, and negative infinity is smaller than all values
except itself and NaN.  NaN is <em>unordered</em>: it is not equal to,
greater than, or less than anything, <em>including itself</em>. <code>x ==
x</code> is false if the value of <code>x</code> is NaN.  You can use this to test
whether a value is NaN or not, but the recommended way to test for NaN
is with the <code>isnan</code> function (see <a href="Floating-Point-Classes.html#Floating-Point-Classes">Floating Point Classes</a>).  In
addition, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> will raise an
exception when applied to NaNs.
</p>
<p><samp>math.h</samp> defines macros that allow you to explicitly set a variable
to infinity or NaN.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-INFINITY"></a>Macro: <em>float</em> <strong>INFINITY</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An expression representing positive infinity.  It is equal to the value
produced  by mathematical operations like <code>1.0 / 0.0</code>.
<code>-INFINITY</code> represents negative infinity.
</p>
<p>You can test whether a floating-point value is infinite by comparing it
to this macro.  However, this is not recommended; you should use the
<code>isfinite</code> macro instead.  See <a href="Floating-Point-Classes.html#Floating-Point-Classes">Floating Point Classes</a>.
</p>
<p>This macro was introduced in the ISO&nbsp;C99<!-- /@w --> standard.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-NAN"></a>Macro: <em>float</em> <strong>NAN</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An expression representing a value which is &ldquo;not a number&rdquo;.  This
macro is a GNU extension, available only on machines that support the
&ldquo;not a number&rdquo; value&mdash;that is to say, on all machines that support
IEEE floating point.
</p>
<p>You can use &lsquo;<samp>#ifdef NAN</samp>&rsquo; to test whether the machine supports
NaN.  (Of course, you must arrange for GNU extensions to be visible,
such as by defining <code>_GNU_SOURCE</code>, and then you must include
<samp>math.h</samp>.)
</p></dd></dl>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;754<!-- /@w --> also allows for another unusual value: negative zero.  This
value is produced when you divide a positive number by negative
infinity, or when a negative result is smaller than the limits of
representation.
