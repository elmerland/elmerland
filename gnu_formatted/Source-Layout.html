<a name="Adding-New-Functions"></a>
<h3 class="appendixsec">D.1 Adding New Functions</h3>

<p>The process of building the library is driven by the makefiles, which
make heavy use of special features of GNU <code>make</code>.  The makefiles
are very complex, and you probably don&rsquo;t want to try to understand them.
But what they do is fairly straightforward, and only requires that you
define a few variables in the right places.
</p>
<p>The library sources are divided into subdirectories, grouped by topic.
</p>
<p>The <samp>string</samp> subdirectory has all the string-manipulation
functions, <samp>math</samp> has all the mathematical functions, etc.
</p>
<p>Each subdirectory contains a simple makefile, called <samp>Makefile</samp>,
which defines a few <code>make</code> variables and then includes the global
makefile <samp>Rules</samp> with a line like:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">include ../Rules
</pre></div>

<p>The basic variables that a subdirectory makefile defines are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>subdir</code></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the subdirectory, for example <samp>stdio</samp>.
This variable <strong>must</strong> be defined.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>headers</code></dt>
<dd><p>The names of the header files in this section of the library,
such as <samp>stdio.h</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>routines</code></dt>
<dt><code>aux</code></dt>
<dd><p>The names of the modules (source files) in this section of the library.
These should be simple names, such as &lsquo;<samp>strlen</samp>&rsquo; (rather than
complete file names, such as <samp>strlen.c</samp>).  Use <code>routines</code> for
modules that define functions in the library, and <code>aux</code> for
auxiliary modules containing things like data definitions.  But the
values of <code>routines</code> and <code>aux</code> are just concatenated, so there
really is no practical difference.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tests</code></dt>
<dd><p>The names of test programs for this section of the library.  These
should be simple names, such as &lsquo;<samp>tester</samp>&rsquo; (rather than complete file
names, such as <samp>tester.c</samp>).  &lsquo;<samp>make&nbsp;tests</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> will build and
run all the test programs.  If a test program needs input, put the test
data in a file called <samp><var>test-program</var>.input</samp>; it will be given to
the test program on its standard input.  If a test program wants to be
run with arguments, put the arguments (all on a single line) in a file
called <samp><var>test-program</var>.args</samp>.  Test programs should exit with
zero status when the test passes, and nonzero status when the test
indicates a bug in the library or error in building.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>others</code></dt>
<dd><p>The names of &ldquo;other&rdquo; programs associated with this section of the
library.  These are programs which are not tests per se, but are other
small programs included with the library.  They are built by
&lsquo;<samp>make&nbsp;others</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>install-lib</code></dt>
<dt><code>install-data</code></dt>
<dt><code>install</code></dt>
<dd><p>Files to be installed by &lsquo;<samp>make&nbsp;install</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Files listed in
&lsquo;<samp>install-lib</samp>&rsquo; are installed in the directory specified by
&lsquo;<samp>libdir</samp>&rsquo; in <samp>configparms</samp> or <samp>Makeconfig</samp>
(see <a href="Installation.html#Installation">Installation</a>).  Files listed in <code>install-data</code> are
installed in the directory specified by &lsquo;<samp>datadir</samp>&rsquo; in
<samp>configparms</samp> or <samp>Makeconfig</samp>.  Files listed in <code>install</code>
are installed in the directory specified by &lsquo;<samp>bindir</samp>&rsquo; in
<samp>configparms</samp> or <samp>Makeconfig</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>distribute</code></dt>
<dd><p>Other files from this subdirectory which should be put into a
distribution tar file.  You need not list here the makefile itself or
the source and header files listed in the other standard variables.
Only define <code>distribute</code> if there are files used in an unusual way
that should go into the distribution.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>generated</code></dt>
<dd><p>Files which are generated by <samp>Makefile</samp> in this subdirectory.
These files will be removed by &lsquo;<samp>make&nbsp;clean</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, and they will
never go into a distribution.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>extra-objs</code></dt>
<dd><p>Extra object files which are built by <samp>Makefile</samp> in this
subdirectory.  This should be a list of file names like <samp>foo.o</samp>;
the files will actually be found in whatever directory object files are
being built in.  These files will be removed by &lsquo;<samp>make&nbsp;clean</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.
This variable is used for secondary object files needed to build
<code>others</code> or <code>tests</code>.
