<h4 class="subsection">28.6.6 Continuing Stopped Jobs</h4>

<a name="index-stopped-jobs_002c-continuing"></a>
<p>The shell can continue a stopped job by sending a <code>SIGCONT</code> signal
to its process group.  If the job is being continued in the foreground,
the shell should first invoke <code>tcsetpgrp</code> to give the job access to
the terminal, and restore the saved terminal settings.  After continuing
a job in the foreground, the shell should wait for the job to stop or
complete, as if the job had just been launched in the foreground.
</p>
<p>The sample shell program handles both newly created and continued jobs
with the same pair of functions, <code><span class="nolinebreak">put_job_in_foreground</span></code><!-- /@w --> and
<code><span class="nolinebreak">put_job_in_background</span></code><!-- /@w -->.  The definitions of these functions
were given in <a href="Foreground-and-Background.html#Foreground-and-Background">Foreground and Background</a>.  When continuing a
stopped job, a nonzero value is passed as the <var>cont</var> argument to
ensure that the <code>SIGCONT</code> signal is sent and the terminal modes
reset, as appropriate.
</p>
<p>This leaves only a function for updating the shell&rsquo;s internal bookkeeping
about the job being continued:

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">/* <span class="roman">Mark a stopped job J as being running again.</span>  */

void
mark_job_as_running (job *j)
{
  Process *p;

  for (p = j-&gt;first_process; p; p = p-&gt;next)
    p-&gt;stopped = 0;
  j-&gt;notified = 0;
}
</pre><pre class="smallexample">
</pre><pre class="smallexample">/* <span class="roman">Continue the job J.</span>  */

void
continue_job (job *j, int foreground)
{
  mark_job_as_running (j);
  if (foreground)
    put_job_in_foreground (j, 1);
  else
    put_job_in_background (j, 1);
}
