<h4 class="subsection">10.4.5 Details of Tilde Expansion</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s a standard part of shell syntax that you can use &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo; at the
beginning of a file name to stand for your own home directory.  You
can use &lsquo;<samp>~<var>user</var></samp>&rsquo; to stand for <var>user</var>&rsquo;s home directory.
</p>
<p><em>Tilde expansion</em> is the process of converting these abbreviations
to the directory names that they stand for.
</p>
<p>Tilde expansion applies to the &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo; plus all following characters up
to whitespace or a slash.  It takes place only at the beginning of a
word, and only if none of the characters to be transformed is quoted in
any way.
</p>
<p>Plain &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo; uses the value of the environment variable <code>HOME</code>
as the proper home directory name.  &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo; followed by a user name
uses <code>getpwname</code> to look up that user in the user database, and
uses whatever directory is recorded there.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo; followed
by your own name can give different results from plain &lsquo;<samp>~</samp>&rsquo;, if
the value of <code>HOME</code> is not really your home directory.
