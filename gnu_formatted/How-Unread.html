<h4 class="subsection">12.10.2 Using <code>ungetc</code> To Do Unreading</h4>

<p>The function to unread a character is called <code>ungetc</code>, because it
reverses the action of <code>getc</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ungetc"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>ungetc</strong> <em>(int <var>c</var>, FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe lock corrupt
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>ungetc</code> function pushes back the character <var>c</var> onto the
input stream <var>stream</var>.  So the next input from <var>stream</var> will
read <var>c</var> before anything else.
</p>
<p>If <var>c</var> is <code>EOF</code>, <code>ungetc</code> does nothing and just returns
<code>EOF</code>.  This lets you call <code>ungetc</code> with the return value of
<code>getc</code> without needing to check for an error from <code>getc</code>.
</p>
<p>The character that you push back doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same as the last
character that was actually read from the stream.  In fact, it isn&rsquo;t
necessary to actually read any characters from the stream before
unreading them with <code>ungetc</code>!  But that is a strange way to write a
program; usually <code>ungetc</code> is used only to unread a character that
was just read from the same stream.  The GNU C Library supports this
even on files opened in binary mode, but other systems might not.
</p>
<p>The GNU C Library only supports one character of pushback&mdash;in other
words, it does not work to call <code>ungetc</code> twice without doing input
in between.  Other systems might let you push back multiple characters;
then reading from the stream retrieves the characters in the reverse
order that they were pushed.
</p>
<p>Pushing back characters doesn&rsquo;t alter the file; only the internal
buffering for the stream is affected.  If a file positioning function
(such as <code>fseek</code>, <code>fseeko</code> or <code>rewind</code>; see <a href="File-Positioning.html#File-Positioning">File Positioning</a>) is called, any pending pushed-back characters are
discarded.
</p>
<p>Unreading a character on a stream that is at end of file clears the
end-of-file indicator for the stream, because it makes the character of
input available.  After you read that character, trying to read again
will encounter end of file.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ungetwc"></a>Function: <em>wint_t</em> <strong>ungetwc</strong> <em>(wint_t <var>wc</var>, FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe lock corrupt
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>ungetwc</code> function behaves just like <code>ungetc</code> just that it
pushes back a wide character.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here is an example showing the use of <code>getc</code> and <code>ungetc</code> to
skip over whitespace characters.  When this function reaches a
non-whitespace character, it unreads that character to be seen again on
the next read operation on the stream.

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

void
skip_whitespace (FILE *stream)
{
  int c;
  do
    /* <span class="roman">No need to check for <code>EOF</code> because it is not</span>
       <span class="roman"><code>isspace</code>, and <code>ungetc</code> ignores <code>EOF</code>.</span>  */
    c = getc (stream);
  while (isspace (c));
  ungetc (c, stream);
}
