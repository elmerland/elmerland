<h3 class="appendixsec">C.3 Recommended Tools for Compilation</h3>
<a name="index-installation-tools"></a>
<a name="index-tools_002c-for-installing-library"></a>

<p>We recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to
build the GNU C Library:
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>make</code> 3.79 or newer

<p>You need the latest version of GNU <code>make</code>.  Modifying the GNU C Library
to work with other <code>make</code> programs would be so difficult that
we recommend you port GNU <code>make</code> instead.  <strong>Really.</strong>  We
recommend GNU <code>make</code> version 3.79.  All earlier versions have severe
bugs or lack features.
</p>
</li><li> GCC 4.6 or newer

<p>GCC 4.6 or higher is required.  In general it is recommended to use
the newest version of the compiler that is known to work for building
the GNU C Library, as newer compilers usually produce better code.  As of
release time, GCC 4.9.2 is the newest compiler verified to work to build
the GNU C Library.
</p>
<p>You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that use
the GNU C Library.
</p>
<p>Check the FAQ for any special compiler issues on particular platforms.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>binutils</code> 2.22 or later

<p>You must use GNU <code>binutils</code> (as and ld) to build the GNU C Library.
No other assembler or linker has the necessary functionality at the
moment. As of release time, GNU <code>binutils</code> 2.25 is the newest
verified to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>texinfo</code> 4.7 or later

<p>To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you need
this version of the <code>texinfo</code> package.  Earlier versions do not
understand all the tags used in the document, and the installation
mechanism for the info files is not present or works differently.
As of release time, <code>texinfo</code> 5.2 is the newest verified to work
to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>awk</code> 3.1.2, or higher

<p><code>awk</code> is used in several places to generate files.
Some <code>gawk</code> extensions are used, including the <code>asorti</code>
function, which was introduced in version 3.1.2 of <code>gawk</code>.
</p>
</li><li> Perl 5

<p>Perl is not required, but it is used if present to test the
installation.  We may decide to use it elsewhere in the future.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>sed</code> 3.02 or newer

<p><code>Sed</code> is used in several places to generate files.  Most scripts work
with any version of <code>sed</code>.  The known exception is the script
<code>po2test.sed</code> in the <code>intl</code> subdirectory which is used to
generate <code>msgs.h</code> for the test suite.  This script works correctly
only with GNU <code>sed</code> 3.02.  If you like to run the test suite, you
should definitely upgrade <code>sed</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>If you change any of the <samp>configure.ac</samp> files you will also need
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>autoconf</code> 2.69 (exactly)
</li></ul>

<p>and if you change any of the message translation files you will need
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>gettext</code> 0.10.36 or later
</li></ul>

<p>If you wish to regenerate the <code>yacc</code> parser code in the <samp>intl</samp>
subdirectory you will need
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>bison</code> 2.7 or later
</li></ul>

<p>You may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using
patches, although we try to avoid this.
