<h4 class="subsection">24.8.3 Using <code>sigsuspend</code></h4>

<p>The clean and reliable way to wait for a signal to arrive is to block it
and then use <code>sigsuspend</code>.  By using <code>sigsuspend</code> in a loop,
you can wait for certain kinds of signals, while letting other kinds of
signals be handled by their handlers.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-sigsuspend"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>sigsuspend</strong> <em>(const sigset_t *<var>set</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:sigprocmask/!bsd!linux
| AS-Unsafe lock/hurd
| AC-Unsafe lock/hurd
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function replaces the process&rsquo;s signal mask with <var>set</var> and then
suspends the process until a signal is delivered whose action is either
to terminate the process or invoke a signal handling function.  In other
words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that
is not a member of <var>set</var> arrives.
</p>
<p>If the process is woken up by delivery of a signal that invokes a handler
function, and the handler function returns, then <code>sigsuspend</code> also
returns.
</p>
<p>The mask remains <var>set</var> only as long as <code>sigsuspend</code> is waiting.
The function <code>sigsuspend</code> always restores the previous signal mask
when it returns.
</p>
<p>The return value and error conditions are the same as for <code>pause</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>With <code>sigsuspend</code>, you can replace the <code>pause</code> or <code>sleep</code>
loop in the previous section with something completely reliable:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">sigset_t mask, oldmask;

&hellip;

/* <span class="roman">Set up the mask of signals to temporarily block.</span> */
sigemptyset (&amp;mask);
sigaddset (&amp;mask, SIGUSR1);

&hellip;

/* <span class="roman">Wait for a signal to arrive.</span> */
sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &amp;mask, &amp;oldmask);
while (!usr_interrupt)
  sigsuspend (&amp;oldmask);
sigprocmask (SIG_UNBLOCK, &amp;mask, NULL);
</pre></div>

<p>This last piece of code is a little tricky.  The key point to remember
here is that when <code>sigsuspend</code> returns, it resets the process&rsquo;s
signal mask to the original value, the value from before the call to
<code>sigsuspend</code>&mdash;in this case, the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal is once
again blocked.  The second call to <code>sigprocmask</code> is
necessary to explicitly unblock this signal.
</p>
<p>One other point: you may be wondering why the <code>while</code> loop is
necessary at all, since the program is apparently only waiting for one
<code>SIGUSR1</code> signal.  The answer is that the mask passed to
<code>sigsuspend</code> permits the process to be woken up by the delivery of
other kinds of signals, as well&mdash;for example, job control signals.  If
the process is woken up by a signal that doesn&rsquo;t set
<code>usr_interrupt</code>, it just suspends itself again until the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
kind of signal eventually arrives.
</p>
<p>This technique takes a few more lines of preparation, but that is needed
just once for each kind of wait criterion you want to use.  The code
that actually waits is just four lines.
