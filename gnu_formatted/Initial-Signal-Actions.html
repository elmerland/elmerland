<h4 class="subsection">24.3.6 Initial Signal Actions</h4>
<a name="index-initial-signal-actions"></a>

<p>When a new process is created (see <a href="Creating-a-Process.html#Creating-a-Process">Creating a Process</a>), it inherits
handling of signals from its parent process.  However, when you load a
new process image using the <code>exec</code> function (see <a href="Executing-a-File.html#Executing-a-File">Executing a File</a>), any signals that you&rsquo;ve defined your own handlers for revert to
their <code>SIG_DFL</code> handling.  (If you think about it a little, this
makes sense; the handler functions from the old program are specific to
that program, and aren&rsquo;t even present in the address space of the new
program image.)  Of course, the new program can establish its own
handlers.
</p>
<p>When a program is run by a shell, the shell normally sets the initial
actions for the child process to <code>SIG_DFL</code> or <code>SIG_IGN</code>, as
appropriate.  It&rsquo;s a good idea to check to make sure that the shell has
not set up an initial action of <code>SIG_IGN</code> before you establish your
own signal handlers.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to establish a handler for <code>SIGHUP</code>, but
not if <code>SIGHUP</code> is currently ignored:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">&hellip;
struct sigaction temp;

sigaction (SIGHUP, NULL, &amp;temp);

if (temp.sa_handler != SIG_IGN)
  {
    temp.sa_handler = handle_sighup;
    sigemptyset (&amp;temp.sa_mask);
    sigaction (SIGHUP, &amp;temp, NULL);
  }
</pre></div>
