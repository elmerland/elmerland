<h4 class="subsection">22.3.5 Limiting execution to certain CPUs</h4>

<p>On a multi-processor system the operating system usually distributes
the different processes which are runnable on all available CPUs in a
way which allows the system to work most efficiently.  Which processes
and threads run can be to some extend be control with the scheduling
functionality described in the last sections.  But which CPU finally
executes which process or thread is not covered.
</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why a program might want to have control
over this aspect of the system as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One thread or process is responsible for absolutely critical work
which under no circumstances must be interrupted or hindered from
making process by other process or threads using CPU resources.  In
this case the special process would be confined to a CPU which no
other process or thread is allowed to use.

</li><li> The access to certain resources (RAM, I/O ports) has different costs
from different CPUs.  This is the case in NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory
Architecture) machines.  Preferably memory should be accessed locally
but this requirement is usually not visible to the scheduler.
Therefore forcing a process or thread to the CPUs which have local
access to the mostly used memory helps to significantly boost the
performance.

</li><li> In controlled runtimes resource allocation and book-keeping work (for
instance garbage collection) is performance local to processors.  This
can help to reduce locking costs if the resources do not have to be
protected from concurrent accesses from different processors.
</li></ul>

<p>The POSIX standard up to this date is of not much help to solve this
problem.  The Linux kernel provides a set of interfaces to allow
specifying <em>affinity sets</em> for a process.  The scheduler will
schedule the thread or process on CPUs specified by the affinity
masks.  The interfaces which the GNU C Library define follow to some
extend the Linux kernel interface.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-cpu_005fset_005ft"></a>Data Type: <strong>cpu_set_t</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This data set is a bitset where each bit represents a CPU.  How the
system&rsquo;s CPUs are mapped to bits in the bitset is system dependent.
The data type has a fixed size; in the unlikely case that the number
of bits are not sufficient to describe the CPUs of the system a
different interface has to be used.
</p>
<p>This type is a GNU extension and is defined in <samp>sched.h</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>To manipulate the bitset, to set and reset bits, a number of macros is
defined.  Some of the macros take a CPU number as a parameter.  Here
it is important to never exceed the size of the bitset.  The following
macro specifies the number of bits in the <code>cpu_set_t</code> bitset.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-CPU_005fSETSIZE"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>CPU_SETSIZE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this macro is the maximum number of CPUs which can be
handled with a <code>cpu_set_t</code> object.

<p>The type <code>cpu_set_t</code> should be considered opaque; all
manipulation should happen via the next four macros.
