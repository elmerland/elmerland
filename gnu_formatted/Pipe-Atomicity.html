<h3 class="section">15.4 Atomicity of Pipe I/O</h3>

<p>Reading or writing pipe data is <em>atomic</em> if the size of data written
is not greater than <code>PIPE_BUF</code>.  This means that the data transfer
seems to be an instantaneous unit, in that nothing else in the system
can observe a state in which it is partially complete.  Atomic I/O may
not begin right away (it may need to wait for buffer space or for data),
but once it does begin it finishes immediately.
</p>
<p>Reading or writing a larger amount of data may not be atomic; for
example, output data from other processes sharing the descriptor may be
interspersed.  Also, once <code>PIPE_BUF</code> characters have been written,
further writes will block until some characters are read.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Limits-for-Files.html#Limits-for-Files">Limits for Files</a>, for information about the <code>PIPE_BUF</code>
parameter.
