<a name="index-auxiliary-vector"></a>

<p>When a program is executed, it receives information from the operating
system about the environment in which it is operating.  The form of this
information is a table of key-value pairs, where the keys are from the
set of &lsquo;<samp>AT_</samp>&rsquo; values in <samp>elf.h</samp>.  Some of the data is provided
by the kernel for libc consumption, and may be obtained by ordinary
interfaces, such as <code>sysconf</code>.  However, on a platform-by-platform
basis there may be information that is not available any other way.

<p>This function is used to inquire about the entries in the auxiliary
vector.  The <var>type</var> argument should be one of the &lsquo;<samp>AT_</samp>&rsquo; symbols
defined in <samp>elf.h</samp>.  If a matching entry is found, the value is
returned; if the entry is not found, zero is returned and <code>errno</code> is
set to <code>ENOENT</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>For some platforms, the key <code>AT_HWCAP</code> is the easiest way to inquire
about any instruction set extensions available at runtime.  In this case,
there will (of necessity) be a platform-specific set of &lsquo;<samp>HWCAP_</samp>&rsquo;
values masked together that describe the capabilities of the cpu on which
the program is being executed.
