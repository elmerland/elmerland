<a name="index-orphaned-process-group"></a>

<p>When a controlling process terminates, its terminal becomes free and a
new session can be established on it.  (In fact, another user could log
in on the terminal.)  This could cause a problem if any processes from
the old session are still trying to use that terminal.
</p>
<p>To prevent problems, process groups that continue running even after the
session leader has terminated are marked as <em>orphaned process
groups</em>.
</p>
<p>When a process group becomes an orphan, its processes are sent a
<code>SIGHUP</code> signal.  Ordinarily, this causes the processes to
terminate.  However, if a program ignores this signal or establishes a
handler for it (see <a href="Signal-Handling.html#Signal-Handling">Signal Handling</a>), it can continue running as in
the orphan process group even after its controlling process terminates;
but it still cannot access the terminal any more.
