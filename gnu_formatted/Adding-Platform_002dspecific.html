<h4 class="appendixsubsec">D.1.1 Platform-specific types, macros and functions</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes necessary to provide nonstandard, platform-specific
features to developers.  The C library is traditionally the
lowest library layer, so it makes sense for it to provide these
low-level features.  However, including these features in the C
library may be a disadvantage if another package provides them
as well as there will be two conflicting versions of them.  Also,
the features won&rsquo;t be available to projects that do not use
the GNU C Library but use other GNU tools, like GCC.
</p>
<p>The current guidelines are:
</p><ul>
<li> If the header file provides features that only make sense on a particular
machine architecture and have nothing to do with an operating system, then
the features should ultimately be provided as GCC built-in functions.  Until
then, the GNU C Library may provide them in the header file.  When the GCC built-in
functions become available, those provided in the header file should be made
conditionally available prior to the GCC version in which the built-in
function was made available.

</li><li> If the header file provides features that are specific to an operating system,
both GCC and the GNU C Library could provide it, but the GNU C Library is preferred
as it already has a lot of information about the operating system.

</li><li> If the header file provides features that are specific to an operating system
but used by the GNU C Library, then the GNU C Library should provide them.
</li></ul>

<p>The general solution for providing low-level features is to export them as
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A nonstandard, low-level header file that defines macros and inline
functions should be called <samp>sys/platform/<var>name</var>.h</samp>.

</li><li> Each header file&rsquo;s name should include the platform name, to avoid
users thinking there is anything in common between different the
header files for different platforms.  For example, a
<samp>sys/platform/<var>arch</var>.h</samp> name such as
<samp>sys/platform/ppc.h</samp> is better than <samp>sys/platform.h</samp>.

</li><li> A platform-specific header file provided by the GNU C Library should coordinate
with GCC such that compiler built-in versions of the functions and macros are
preferred if available.  This means that user programs will only ever need to
include <samp>sys/platform/<var>arch</var>.h</samp>, keeping the same names of types,
macros, and functions for convenience and portability.

</li><li> Each included symbol must have the prefix <code>__<var>arch</var>_</code>, such as
<code>__ppc_get_timebase</code>.
</li></ul>


<p>The easiest way to provide a header file is to add it to the
<code>sysdep_headers</code> variable.  For example, the combination of
Linux-specific header files on PowerPC could be provided like this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">sysdep_headers += sys/platform/ppc.h
</pre></div>

<p>Then ensure that you have added a <samp>sys/platform/ppc.h</samp>
header file in the machine-specific directory, e.g.,
<samp>sysdeps/powerpc/sys/platform/ppc.h</samp>.
