<h4 class="subsection">11.2.1 Directories</h4>

<p>In order to understand the syntax of file names, you need to understand
how the file system is organized into a hierarchy of directories.
</p>
<a name="index-directory"></a>
<a name="index-link"></a>
<a name="index-directory-entry"></a>
<p>A <em>directory</em> is a file that contains information to associate other
files with names; these associations are called <em>links</em> or
<em>directory entries</em>.  Sometimes, people speak of &ldquo;files in a
directory&rdquo;, but in reality, a directory only contains pointers to
files, not the files themselves.
</p>
<a name="index-file-name-component"></a>
<p>The name of a file contained in a directory entry is called a <em>file
name component</em>.  In general, a file name consists of a sequence of one
or more such components, separated by the slash character (&lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;).  A
file name which is just one component names a file with respect to its
directory.  A file name with multiple components names a directory, and
then a file in that directory, and so on.
</p>
<p>Some other documents, such as the POSIX standard, use the term
<em>pathname</em> for what we call a file name, and either <em>filename</em>
or <em>pathname component</em> for what this manual calls a file name
component.  We don&rsquo;t use this terminology because a &ldquo;path&rdquo; is
something completely different (a list of directories to search), and we
think that &ldquo;pathname&rdquo; used for something else will confuse users.  We
always use &ldquo;file name&rdquo; and &ldquo;file name component&rdquo; (or sometimes just
&ldquo;component&rdquo;, where the context is obvious) in GNU documentation.  Some
macros use the POSIX terminology in their names, such as
<code>PATH_MAX</code>.  These macros are defined by the POSIX standard, so we
cannot change their names.
