<dt><a name="index-mtrace"></a>Function: <em>void</em> <strong>mtrace</strong> <em>(void)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe env race:mtrace const:malloc_hooks init

<p>When the <code>mtrace</code> function is called it looks for an environment
variable named <code>MALLOC_TRACE</code>.  This variable is supposed to
contain a valid file name.  The user must have write access.  If the
file already exists it is truncated.  If the environment variable is not
set or it does not name a valid file which can be opened for writing
nothing is done.  The behavior of <code>malloc</code> etc. is not changed.
For obvious reasons this also happens if the application is installed
with the SUID or SGID bit set.
</p>
<p>If the named file is successfully opened, <code>mtrace</code> installs special
handlers for the functions <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and
<code>free</code> (see <a href="Hooks-for-Malloc.html#Hooks-for-Malloc">Hooks for Malloc</a>).  From then on, all uses of these
functions are traced and protocolled into the file.  There is now of
course a speed penalty for all calls to the traced functions so tracing
should not be enabled during normal use.
</p>
<p>This function is a GNU extension and generally not available on other
systems.  The prototype can be found in <samp>mcheck.h</samp>.

<dt><a name="index-muntrace"></a>Function: <em>void</em> <strong>muntrace</strong> <em>(void)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:mtrace const:malloc_hooks locale
| AS-Unsafe corrupt heap
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem lock fd
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>


<p>The <code>muntrace</code> function can be called after <code>mtrace</code> was used
to enable tracing the <code>malloc</code> calls.  If no (successful) call of
<code>mtrace</code> was made <code>muntrace</code> does nothing.
</p>
<p>Otherwise it deinstalls the handlers for <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>,
and <code>free</code> and then closes the protocol file.  No calls are
protocolled anymore and the program runs again at full speed.
</p>
<p>This function is a GNU extension and generally not available on other
systems.  The prototype can be found in <samp>mcheck.h</samp>.
