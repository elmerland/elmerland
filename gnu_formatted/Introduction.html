<p>The C language provides no built-in facilities for performing such
common operations as input/output, memory management, string
manipulation, and the like.  Instead, these facilities are defined
in a standard <em>library</em>, which you compile and link with your
programs.
<a name="index-library"></a>
</p>
<p>The GNU C Library, described in this document, defines all of the
library functions that are specified by the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard, as well as
additional features specific to POSIX and other derivatives of the Unix
operating system, and extensions specific to GNU systems.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to tell you how to use the facilities
of the GNU C Library.  We have mentioned which features belong to which
standards to help you identify things that are potentially non-portable
to other systems.  But the emphasis in this manual is not on strict
portability.
