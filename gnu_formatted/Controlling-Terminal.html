<h3 class="section">28.3 Controlling Terminal of a Process</h3>

<p>One of the attributes of a process is its controlling terminal.  Child
processes created with <code>fork</code> inherit the controlling terminal from
their parent process.  In this way, all the processes in a session
inherit the controlling terminal from the session leader.  A session
leader that has control of a terminal is called the <em>controlling
process</em> of that terminal.
</p>

<p>You generally do not need to worry about the exact mechanism used to
allocate a controlling terminal to a session, since it is done for you
by the system when you log in.
</p>
<p>An individual process disconnects from its controlling terminal when it
calls <code>setsid</code> to become the leader of a new session.
