<h3 class="section">26.2 Process Creation Concepts</h3>

<p>This section gives an overview of processes and of the steps involved in
creating a process and making it run another program.
</p>
<a name="index-process-ID"></a>
<a name="index-process-lifetime"></a>
<p>Each process is named by a <em>process ID</em> number.  A unique process ID
is allocated to each process when it is created.  The <em>lifetime</em> of
a process ends when its termination is reported to its parent process;
at that time, all of the process resources, including its process ID,
are freed.
</p>

<a name="index-child-process-2"></a>
<a name="index-parent-process-1"></a>
<p>Processes are created with the <code>fork</code> system call (so the operation
of creating a new process is sometimes called <em>forking</em> a process).
The <em>child process</em> created by <code>fork</code> is a copy of the original
<em>parent process</em>, except that it has its own process ID.
</p>
<p>After forking a child process, both the parent and child processes
continue to execute normally.  If you want your program to wait for a
child process to finish executing before continuing, you must do this
explicitly after the fork operation, by calling <code>wait</code> or
<code>waitpid</code> (see <a href="Process-Completion.html#Process-Completion">Process Completion</a>).  These functions give you
limited information about why the child terminated&mdash;for example, its
exit status code.
</p>
<p>A newly forked child process continues to execute the same program as
its parent process, at the point where the <code>fork</code> call returns.
You can use the return value from <code>fork</code> to tell whether the program
is running in the parent process or the child.
</p>
<a name="index-process-image"></a>
<p>Having several processes run the same program is only occasionally
useful.  But the child can execute another program using one of the
<code>exec</code> functions; see <a href="Executing-a-File.html#Executing-a-File">Executing a File</a>.  The program that the
process is executing is called its <em>process image</em>.  Starting
execution of a new program causes the process to forget all about its
previous process image; when the new program exits, the process exits
too, instead of returning to the previous process image.
