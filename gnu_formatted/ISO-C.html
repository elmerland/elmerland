<p>The GNU C Library is compatible with the C standard adopted by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI):
<cite>American National Standard X3.159-1989&mdash;&ldquo;ANSI C&rdquo;</cite> and later
by the International Standardization Organization (ISO):
<cite>ISO/IEC 9899:1990, &ldquo;Programming languages&mdash;C&rdquo;</cite>.
We here refer to the standard as ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> since this is the more
general standard in respect of ratification.
The header files and library facilities that make up the GNU C Library are
a superset of those specified by the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard.

<p>If you are concerned about strict adherence to the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard, you
should use the &lsquo;<samp>-ansi</samp>&rsquo; option when you compile your programs with
the GNU C compiler.  This tells the compiler to define <em>only</em> ISO
standard features from the library header files, unless you explicitly
ask for additional features.  See <a href="Feature-Test-Macros.html#Feature-Test-Macros">Feature Test Macros</a>, for
information on how to do this.
</p>
<p>Being able to restrict the library to include only ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> features is
important because ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> puts limitations on what names can be defined
by the library implementation, and the GNU extensions don&rsquo;t fit these
limitations.  See <a href="Reserved-Names.html#Reserved-Names">Reserved Names</a>, for more information about these
restrictions.
</p>
<p>This manual does not attempt to give you complete details on the
differences between ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> and older dialects.  It gives advice on how
to write programs to work portably under multiple C dialects, but does
not aim for completeness.
