<h3 class="section">7.5 Standard Locales</h3>

<p>The only locale names you can count on finding on all operating systems
are these three standard ones:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>&quot;C&quot;</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard C locale.  The attributes and behavior it provides
are specified in the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard.  When your program starts up, it
initially uses this locale by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&quot;POSIX&quot;</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the standard POSIX locale.  Currently, it is an alias for the
standard C locale.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&quot;&quot;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The empty name says to select a locale based on environment variables.
See <a href="Locale-Categories.html#Locale-Categories">Locale Categories</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Defining and installing named locales is normally a responsibility of
the system administrator at your site (or the person who installed
the GNU C Library).  It is also possible for the user to create private
locales.  All this will be discussed later when describing the tool to
do so.
</p>
<p>If your program needs to use something other than the &lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo; locale,
it will be more portable if you use whatever locale the user specifies
with the environment, rather than trying to specify some non-standard
locale explicitly by name.  Remember, different machines might have
different sets of locales installed.
