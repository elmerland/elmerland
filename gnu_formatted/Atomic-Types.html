<h4 class="subsubsection">24.4.7.2 Atomic Types</h4>

<p>To avoid uncertainty about interrupting access to a variable, you can
use a particular data type for which access is always atomic:
<code>sig_atomic_t</code>.  Reading and writing this data type is guaranteed
to happen in a single instruction, so there&rsquo;s no way for a handler to
run &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo; of an access.
</p>
<p>The type <code>sig_atomic_t</code> is always an integer data type, but which
one it is, and how many bits it contains, may vary from machine to
machine.
</p>

<dd><p>This is an integer data type.  Objects of this type are always accessed
atomically.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>In practice, you can assume that <code>int</code> is atomic.
You can also assume that pointer
types are atomic; that is very convenient.  Both of these assumptions
are true on all of the machines that the GNU C Library supports and on
all POSIX systems we know of.
