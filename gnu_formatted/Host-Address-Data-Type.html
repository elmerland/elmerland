<h4 class="subsubsection">16.6.2.2 Host Address Data Type</h4>

<p>IPv4 Internet host addresses are represented in some contexts as integers
(type <code>uint32_t</code>).  In other contexts, the integer is
packaged inside a structure of type <code>struct in_addr</code>.  It would
be better if the usage were made consistent, but it is not hard to extract
the integer from the structure or put the integer into a structure.
</p>
<p>You will find older code that uses <code>unsigned long int</code> for
IPv4 Internet host addresses instead of <code>uint32_t</code> or <code>struct
in_addr</code>.  Historically <code>unsigned long int</code> was a 32-bit number but
with 64-bit machines this has changed.  Using <code>unsigned long int</code>
might break the code if it is used on machines where this type doesn&rsquo;t
have 32 bits.  <code>uint32_t</code> is specified by Unix98 and guaranteed to have
32 bits.
</p>
<p>IPv6 Internet host addresses have 128 bits and are packaged inside a
structure of type <code>struct in6_addr</code>.
</p>
<p>The following basic definitions for Internet addresses are declared in
the header file <samp>netinet/in.h</samp>:
<a name="index-netinet_002fin_002eh-1"></a>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-struct-in_005faddr"></a>Data Type: <strong>struct in_addr</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This data type is used in certain contexts to contain an IPv4 Internet
host address.  It has just one field, named <code>s_addr</code>, which records
the host address number as an <code>uint32_t</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-INADDR_005fLOOPBACK"></a>Macro: <em>uint32_t</em> <strong>INADDR_LOOPBACK</strong></dt>
<dd><p>You can use this constant to stand for &ldquo;the address of this machine,&rdquo;
instead of finding its actual address.  It is the IPv4 Internet address
&lsquo;<samp>127.0.0.1</samp>&rsquo;, which is usually called &lsquo;<samp>localhost</samp>&rsquo;.  This
special constant saves you the trouble of looking up the address of your
own machine.  Also, the system usually implements <code>INADDR_LOOPBACK</code>
specially, avoiding any network traffic for the case of one machine
talking to itself.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-INADDR_005fANY"></a>Macro: <em>uint32_t</em> <strong>INADDR_ANY</strong></dt>
<dd><p>You can use this constant to stand for &ldquo;any incoming address&rdquo; when
binding to an address.  See <a href="Setting-Address.html#Setting-Address">Setting Address</a>.  This is the usual
address to give in the <code>sin_addr</code> member of <code>struct&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">sockaddr_in</span></code><!-- /@w --> when you want to accept Internet connections.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-INADDR_005fBROADCAST"></a>Macro: <em>uint32_t</em> <strong>INADDR_BROADCAST</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This constant is the address you use to send a broadcast message.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-INADDR_005fNONE"></a>Macro: <em>uint32_t</em> <strong>INADDR_NONE</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This constant is returned by some functions to indicate an error.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-struct-in6_005faddr"></a>Data Type: <strong>struct in6_addr</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This data type is used to store an IPv6 address.  It stores 128 bits of
data, which can be accessed (via a union) in a variety of ways.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-in6addr_005floopback"></a>Constant: <em>struct in6_addr</em> <strong>in6addr_loopback</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This constant is the IPv6 address &lsquo;<samp>::1</samp>&rsquo;, the loopback address.  See
above for a description of what this means.  The macro
<code>IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT</code> is provided to allow you to initialize your
own variables to this value.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-in6addr_005fany"></a>Constant: <em>struct in6_addr</em> <strong>in6addr_any</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This constant is the IPv6 address &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo;, the unspecified address.  See
above for a description of what this means.  The macro
<code>IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT</code> is provided to allow you to initialize your
own variables to this value.
</p></dd></dl>
