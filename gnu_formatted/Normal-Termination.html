<h4 class="subsection">25.7.1 Normal Termination</h4>

<p>A process terminates normally when its program signals it is done by
calling <code>exit</code>.  Returning from <code>main</code> is equivalent to
calling <code>exit</code>, and the value that <code>main</code> returns is used as
the argument to <code>exit</code>.

</p>

<p>The <code>exit</code> function tells the system that the program is done, which
causes it to terminate the process.
</p>
<p><var>status</var> is the program&rsquo;s exit status, which becomes part of the
process&rsquo; termination status.  This function does not return.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Normal termination causes the following actions:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Functions that were registered with the <code>atexit</code> or <code>on_exit</code>
functions are called in the reverse order of their registration.  This
mechanism allows your application to specify its own &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; actions
to be performed at program termination.  Typically, this is used to do
things like saving program state information in a file, or unlocking
locks in shared data bases.

</li><li> All open streams are closed, writing out any buffered output data.  See
<a href="Closing-Streams.html#Closing-Streams">Closing Streams</a>.  In addition, temporary files opened
with the <code>tmpfile</code> function are removed; see <a href="Temporary-Files.html#Temporary-Files">Temporary Files</a>.

</li><li> <code>_exit</code> is called, terminating the program.  See <a href="Termination-Internals.html#Termination-Internals">Termination Internals</a>.
</li></ol>
