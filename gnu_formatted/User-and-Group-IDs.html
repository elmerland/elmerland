<p>Each user account on a computer system is identified by a <em>user
name</em> (or <em>login name</em>) and <em>user ID</em>.  Normally, each user name
has a unique user ID, but it is possible for several login names to have
the same user ID.  The user names and corresponding user IDs are stored
in a data base which you can access as described in <a href="User-Database.html#User-Database">User Database</a>.

<p>Users are classified in <em>groups</em>.  Each user name belongs to one
<em>default group</em> and may also belong to any number of
<em>supplementary groups</em>.  Users who are members of the same group can
share resources (such as files) that are not accessible to users who are
not a member of that group.  Each group has a <em>group name</em> and
<em>group ID</em>.  See <a href="Group-Database.html#Group-Database">Group Database</a>, for how to find information
about a group ID or group name.
