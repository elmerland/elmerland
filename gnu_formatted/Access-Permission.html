<p>Recall that the operating system normally decides access permission for
a file based on the effective user and group IDs of the process and its
supplementary group IDs, together with the file&rsquo;s owner, group and
permission bits.  These concepts are discussed in detail in <a href="Process-Persona.html#Process-Persona">Process Persona</a>.
</p>
<p>If the effective user ID of the process matches the owner user ID of the
file, then permissions for read, write, and execute/search are
controlled by the corresponding &ldquo;user&rdquo; (or &ldquo;owner&rdquo;) bits.  Likewise,
if any of the effective group ID or supplementary group IDs of the
process matches the group owner ID of the file, then permissions are
controlled by the &ldquo;group&rdquo; bits.  Otherwise, permissions are controlled
by the &ldquo;other&rdquo; bits.
</p>
<p>Privileged users, like &lsquo;<samp>root</samp>&rsquo;, can access any file regardless of
its permission bits.  As a special case, for a file to be executable
even by a privileged user, at least one of its execute bits must be set.
