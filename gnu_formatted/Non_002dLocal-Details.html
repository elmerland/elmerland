<h3 class="section">23.2 Details of Non-Local Exits</h3>

<p>Here are the details on the functions and data structures used for
performing non-local exits.  These facilities are declared in
<samp>setjmp.h</samp>.
<a name="index-setjmp_002eh"></a>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-jmp_005fbuf"></a>Data Type: <strong>jmp_buf</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Objects of type <code>jmp_buf</code> hold the state information to
be restored by a non-local exit.  The contents of a <code>jmp_buf</code>
identify a specific place to return to.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-setjmp"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>setjmp</strong> <em>(jmp_buf <var>state</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>When called normally, <code>setjmp</code> stores information about the
execution state of the program in <var>state</var> and returns zero.  If
<code>longjmp</code> is later used to perform a non-local exit to this
<var>state</var>, <code>setjmp</code> returns a nonzero value.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-longjmp-1"></a>Function: <em>void</em> <strong>longjmp</strong> <em>(jmp_buf <var>state</var>, int <var>value</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe plugin corrupt lock/hurd
| AC-Unsafe corrupt lock/hurd
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function restores current execution to the state saved in
<var>state</var>, and continues execution from the call to <code>setjmp</code> that
established that return point.  Returning from <code>setjmp</code> by means of
<code>longjmp</code> returns the <var>value</var> argument that was passed to
<code>longjmp</code>, rather than <code>0</code>.  (But if <var>value</var> is given as
<code>0</code>, <code>setjmp</code> returns <code>1</code>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>There are a lot of obscure but important restrictions on the use of
<code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>.  Most of these restrictions are
present because non-local exits require a fair amount of magic on the
part of the C compiler and can interact with other parts of the language
in strange ways.
</p>
<p>The <code>setjmp</code> function is actually a macro without an actual
function definition, so you shouldn&rsquo;t try to &lsquo;<samp>#undef</samp>&rsquo; it or take
its address.  In addition, calls to <code>setjmp</code> are safe in only the
following contexts:
</p>
<ul>
<li> As the test expression of a selection or iteration
statement (such as &lsquo;<samp>if</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>switch</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo;).

</li><li> As one operand of an equality or comparison operator that appears as the
test expression of a selection or iteration statement.  The other
operand must be an integer constant expression.

</li><li> As the operand of a unary &lsquo;<samp>!</samp>&rsquo; operator, that appears as the
test expression of a selection or iteration statement.

</li><li> By itself as an expression statement.
</li></ul>

<p>Return points are valid only during the dynamic extent of the function
that called <code>setjmp</code> to establish them.  If you <code>longjmp</code> to
a return point that was established in a function that has already
returned, unpredictable and disastrous things are likely to happen.
</p>
<p>You should use a nonzero <var>value</var> argument to <code>longjmp</code>.  While
<code>longjmp</code> refuses to pass back a zero argument as the return value
from <code>setjmp</code>, this is intended as a safety net against accidental
misuse and is not really good programming style.
</p>
<p>When you perform a non-local exit, accessible objects generally retain
whatever values they had at the time <code>longjmp</code> was called.  The
exception is that the values of automatic variables local to the
function containing the <code>setjmp</code> call that have been changed since
the call to <code>setjmp</code> are indeterminate, unless you have declared
them <code>volatile</code>.
