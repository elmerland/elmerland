      <h1>Biography</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Originally born in El Salvador, I am a senior in Computer Science
      at Virginia Tech. My passion for learning drives me to constantly
      innovate and embrace change. The best way to learn, however, is by
      doing. The application of theoretical knowledge to the wonderfully
      complex and imperfect world we live in is what keeps me motivated.
      I strive to strike a balance between pragmatism, theory and
      research. Whenever possible I also try to incorporate other
      disciplines and areas of study into my work. It is by this mixture
      of different areas of expertise and working with other highly
      motivated individuals that I believe the best type of work can be
      achieved. I love working in groups. In my experience a group of
      well balanced individuals can out perform any lone ranger (however
      brilliant he/she might be) any day of the week. After all, we human
      beings are social creatures.

    <p>
      These are some projects I have worked on in school, during my undergraduate research and my internship.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Web Server</dt>
      <dd>Developed a simple HTTP server that followed the HTTP/1.0 and
        1.1 standard. I implemented this in C and gained expereince in
        dealing with network connections, sockets, pipes, and thread
        pools.</dd>
      <dt>Memory Allocator</dt>
      <dd>This memory allocator supported the same functionality as
        <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, and <code>realloc</code>.
        On top of having the same functionality as these functions it
        also had comparable performance (92%). This memory allocator was
        also design to work on 32 and 64-bit architectures.</dd>
      <dt>B-Tree visualization infrastructure</dt>
      <dd>While working with
        <a href="http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA/">OpenDSA</a>, I extended a
        JavaScript visualization library to support the creation of
        B-Tree. This involved the modification and adaptation of
        existing data structures to allow for the needs of a B-Tree.
        Currently, I'm in the process of implementing the B-Tree
        algorithm in JavaScript that will drive the visualization.</dd>
      <dt>Web Development Club</dt>
      <dd>Working with the
        <a href="http://www.webdev.org.vt.edu/">Web Development Club</a> at
        Virginia Tech. I have had the opportunity to work with a group of
        enthusiastic people and we are attempting to launch  this club and
        increase its membership and presence on campus.
      </dd>
      <dt>Capstone: Ephemeral Hadoop</dt>
      <dd>Experimenting with gossip protocols and Hadoop to create a system that
        can create a network on the fly and from that network start running
        jobs. This project is a proof of concept that could theoretically be
        used in areas of natural disasters as a way to get the internet up and
        running as fast as possible. In addition to running mission critical
        jobs on the network created by the gossip protocol.
